# FriendsCraft

Partly mod development exercise

A mod to add some ANIMAL BEPPINS to Minecraft

Inspired by KemonoCraft except this one will actually be good

<hr>

## Finding Friends

Friends currently spawn randomly in their designated biomes. 
In the future, there will be smarter logic for limiting their spawn to one friend of a certain type every
100 or so blocks, as well as "group spawning" where associated friends will spawn with another.

## Taming Friends

Friends can be tamed using a japari bun, which is crafted like so:

(Yellow bun) [Wheat Sugar Wheat]

## Healing Friends

Friends can be healed by any food item in the game, restoring X amount of hearts based on its hunger restoration

## Notes

Friends currently don't follow the owner

Friends currently don't assist the owner in attacks

Friends currently don't retaliate against whatever is attacking the owner

Eating animation does not work

**Friends will not be overpowered like the KemonoCraft friends** and 
**will not become spawnkillers if you accidentally hit them**
