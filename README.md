Also me learning while I move from mcreator to actual java modding, allowing me to make fabric mods for the latest version (1.21) instead of forge mods (ew) for 1.16

No forge version will ever be made because that should've been left in the past when fabric hit the scene and when the forge devs got caught in a major pickle.
if you want forge then play kemonocraft but beware kemonocraft sucks
